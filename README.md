## WallOfSheep
- Used in a man-in-the-middle attack
- Primarily used for showing what kind of information is visible

## Support
- Currently only working for WiFi Pineapple, with any version of PineAP (installing the latest usually works)
- Only tested with Pineapple Tetra (Nano should work)

## Installation
- Install DWall from the PineAP modules list
- Clone this repo onto a machine, then SCP it over onto DWall. This is because the Pineapple may not have enough space for git
- Modify frontend to your likings. It uses jQuery to display the information needed

## Data captured from common sites
- SessionIDs / tokens, Usernames, advertisement tracking, & personal metadata
